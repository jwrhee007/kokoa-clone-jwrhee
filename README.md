# Kokoa Clone

This Github repository serves a purpose of learning HTML and CSS by cloning KokoaTalk, following the course of [Nomad Coders](https://nomadcoders.co/kokoa-clone). 

## Signup Screen part One

First, we will be cloning the signup screen of KokoaTalk, and since this will be the first screen we will be seeing, the file name should be `index.html`. 

On VSCode, you are not required to write all the format essential for HTML file. if you create an HTML file and type in `!`, it will show you an emmet abbrevation. Now press Enter, and it will present you a decent HTML format including head, body, and so on. 

Also, when you try to create class or ID but you are afraid that it may be generic, make it long by using underscore (`_`). For example, in this case, we used `status-bar__column` as class name which uses two underscore.
